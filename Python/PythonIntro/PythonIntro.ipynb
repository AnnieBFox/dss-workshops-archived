    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a relatively easy to learn general purpose programming language. People use python to manipulate, analyze, and vizualize data, make web sites, write games, and much more. Youtube, DropBox, and BitTorrent are among the things people used python to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most popular open source programming languages, Python can be thought of as a *platform* that runs a huge number and variety of packages. The language itself is mostly valuable because it makes it relatively easy to create and use a large number of useful packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I interact with Python?\n",
    "A number of interfaces designed to make it easy to interact with Python are available. The Anaconda distribution that we installed earlier includes both a web-based *Jupyter Notebook* and a more conventional Integrated Development Environment called *Spyder*. For this workshop I encourage you to use *Jupyter Notebook*. In real life you should experiment and choose the interface that you find most comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, start the *Jupyter Notebook* application, and navigate to the *PythonIntro* directory you downloaded and extracted earlier. Start a new notebook by clicking `New => Python 3` as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![notebook_new.png](./img/notebook_new.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook contains one or more *cells* containing notes or code. To insert a new cell click the `+` button in the upper left. To execute a cell, select it and press `Control+Enter`."
