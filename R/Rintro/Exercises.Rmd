## Exercise 0

The purpose of this exercise is to give you an opportunity to explore
the interface provided by RStudio (or whichever GUI you've decided to
use). You may not know how to do these things; that's fine! This is an
opportunity to figure it out.

Also keep in mind that we are living in a golden age of tab completion.
If you don't know the name of an R function, try guessing the first two
or three letters and pressing TAB. If you guessed correctly the function
you are looking for should appear in a pop up!

1.  Try to get R to add 2 plus 2.

2.  Try to calculate the square root of 10.

3.  R includes extensive documentation, including a file named "An
    introduction to R". Try to find this help file.


## Exercise 1: Reading data

The first step of our analysis of baby names is to read the data into R. 

1. Start by opening the help page for the `read_csv` function so you can refer
to the documentation if needed.

2, Read the baby names using the `read_csv` function and assign the result 
with the name `baby.names`.

3. BONUS (optional): Using 
https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf 
as a guide, save the `baby.names` data as a Stata data set `babynames.dta` 
and as an R data set `babynames.rds`.

## Exercise 2: Peak popularity of your name

Read in the "babyNames.csv" file if you have not already done so,
assigning the result to `baby.names`. The file is located at "http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/data/babyNames.csv"

1.  Use `filter` to extract data for your name (or another name of your choice).  

2.  Arrange the data you produced in step 1 above by `Count`. 
    In which year was the name most popular?

3.  BONUS (optional): Identify the most popular boys name in 1999.

## Exercise 3: Data manipulation

Our next goal is to identify the most popular names. Picking an arbitrary 
cuttof of $2%$ we will filter the data to include only the most popular
baby names.

1.  1.  Use `mutate` and `group_by` to create a column named "Proportion"
    where `Proportion = Count/sum(Count)` for each `Year X Sex` group.

2.  Create a column named "Popular" containing `TRUE` in rows where "Proportion" is greater than 0.02 and a `FALSE` otherwise.

3.  Filter the baby names data to display only the popular names.

## Exercise 4: Group by and summarize

1.  Calculate the total number of children born.

2.  Calculate the number of boys and girls born each year. Assign the result
    to the name `births.by.year`.

3.  How many children were born in 2004?


## Exercise 5: Popularity of the most popular names
----------

In this exercise we will plot trends in the proportion of boys and girls given the most popular name each year.

1.  Filter the baby.names data, retaining only the most popular girl
    and boy names for each year.

2.  Plot proportion over time to see changes in the proportion of
    who chose the most popular name of the year.
