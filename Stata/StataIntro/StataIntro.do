* 1 Introduction
* ==============
* 
* 1.1 Documents for today                                       :labsetup:
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   Laptop users: you will need a copy of Stata installed on your machine
*
*   Lab computer users: log in using the user name and password on the board to your left
*
*   Everyone:
*   - Open a web broswer and download class materials from
*     http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/Stata/StataIntro.zip
*   - Download and extract to your desktop!
* 
* 
* 1.2 Organization
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Please feel free to ask questions at any point if they are relevant
*     to the current topic (or if you are lost!)
*     - There will be a Q&A after class for more specific, personalized
*       questions
*   - Collaboration with your neighbors is encouraged
*   - If you are using a laptop, you will need to adjust paths accordingly
*   - Make comments in your Do-file rather than on hand-outs
*     - save on flash drive or email to yourself
* 
* 
* 1.3 Workshop descripton
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - This is an *introduction* to Stata
*   - Assumes no/very little knowledge of Stata
*   - Not appropriate for people already well familiar with Stata
*   - Learning Objectives:
*     - Familiarize yourself with the Stata interface
*     - Get data in and out of Stata
*     - Compute statistics and construct graphical displays
*     - Compute new variables and transformations
* 
* 
* 1.4 Why stata?
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Used in a variety of disciplines
*   - User-friendly
*   - Great guides available on web (as well as in HMDC computer lab
*     library)
*   - Student and other discount packages available at reasonable cost
* 
* 
* 1.5 Stata interface
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   [file:images/StataInterface.png]
* 
*   - Review and Variable windows can be closed (user preference)
*   - Command window can be shortened (recommended)
* 
* 
* 1.6 Do-files
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - You can type all the same commands into the Do-file that you would
*     type into the command window
*   - BUT...the Do-file allows you to *save* your commands
*   - Your Do-file should contain ALL commands you executed -- at least
*     all the "correct" commands!
*   - I recommend never using the command window or menus to make CHANGES
*     to data
*   - Saving commands in Do-file allows you to keep a written record of
*     everything you have done to your data
*     - Allows easy replication
*     - Allows you to go back and re-run commands, analyses and make
*       modifications
* 
* 
* 1.7 Stata help
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Easiest way to get help in Stata - just type *help* followed by
*     topic or command, e.g., *help regress*
*   - Falls back to "search" if command not found
*   - Generally, if you google "Stata [topic]," you'll get some helpful
*     hits
*   - UCLA website: [http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/Stata/]
* 
* 
* 1.8 General Stata command syntax
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Most Stata commands follow the same underlying principles *Command
*     varlist, options*, e.g., *sum var1 var2, detail*
*     - CAUTION - in some cases, if you type a command and don't specify
*       a variable, Stata will perform the command on all variables in
*       your dataset
*   - You can find command-specific syntax in the help files
* 
* 
* 1.9 Commenting and formatting syntax
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Start with comment describing your Do-file and use comments
*     throughout
*   - Single line and block comments
*   ,----
*   | // comment
*   |  describe var
*   |  /*
*   |  comment block comment block comment block comment
*   |  block comment block comment block 
*   | */
*   `----
*   - Use /// to break varlists over multiple lines:
*   ,----
*   | // break commands over multible lines
*   | describe var1 var2 var2 ///
*   | var4 var5 var6
*   `----
* 
* 
* 1.10 Let's get started
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Launch the Stata program (MP or SE, does not matter unless doing
*     computationally intensive work)
*     - Open up a new Do-file
*     - Run our first Stata code!
* 

// change directory
cd "C://Users/dataclass/Desktop/StataIntro"
// start a log file to record your stata session
log using myStataLog.txt, text replace
// Pause / resume logging with "log on" / "log off"
// Close lot with "log close"

* 
* 
* 1.11 How to start every do-file
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   1. Describe what the file does
*   2. Change directory
*   3. Begin log file
*   4. Call up data
*   5. Do stuff: Data manipulation, statistics etc.
*   6. Save data under new name (if making changes to dataset)
* 
* 
* 2 Getting data into Stata
* =========================
* 
* 2.1 Data file commands
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Next, we want to open our data file
*   - Open/save data sets with "use" and "save":
* 

cd dataSets
// open the gss.dta data set
use gss.dta
// saving your data file:
save newgss.dta, replace
// the "replace" option tells stata it's OK to 
//   write over an existing file

* 
* 
* 2.2 A note about path names
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - If your path has no spaces in the name (that means all directories,
*     folders, file names, etc. can have no spaces), you can write the
*     path as is
*   - If there are spaces, you need to put your pathname in quotes
*   - Best to get in the habit of quoting paths
* 
* 
* 2.3 Where's my data?
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Data editor (*browse*)
*   - Data editor (*edit*)
*     - Using the data editor is discouraged (why?)
*   - Always keep any changes to your data in your Do-file
*   - Avoid temptation of making manual changes by viewing data via the
*     browser rather than editor
* 
* 
* 2.4 What if my data is not a Stata file?
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Import delimited text files

/* import data from a .csv file */
insheet using gss.csv, clear
/* save data to a .csv file */
outsheet using gss_new.csv, replace comma

* 
*   - Import data from SAS and Excel

/* import/export SAS xport files */
clear
import sasxport gss.xpt
export sasxport newFileName, replace

/* import/export data from Excel */
import excel using gss.xlsx, firstrow clear
export excel newFileName.xls, replace

* 
* 
* 2.5 What if my data is from another statistical software program?
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - SPSS/PASW will allow you to save your data as a Stata file
*     - Go to: file > save as > Stata (use most recent version available)
*     - Then you can just go into Stata and open it
*   - Another option is *StatTransfer*, a program that converts data
*     from/to many common formats, including SAS, SPSS, Stata, and many
*     more
* 
* 
* 2.6 Exercise 1: Importing data
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   1. Close down Stata and open a new session
*   2. Go through the three steps for starting each Stata session that we
*      reviewed
*      - Begin a log file
*      - Open your Stata dataset (gss.dta)
*      - Save your Stata dataset using a different name
*   3. Try opening the following files:
*      - A comma separated value file: gss.csv
*      - A SPSS file: gss.sav
*      - A SAS transport file: gss.xpt
* 
* 
* 3 Statistics and graphs
* =======================
* 
* 3.1 Basic graphing commands
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Univariate distribution(s) using *hist*

/* Histograms */
hist educ
// histogram with normal curve; see 'help hist' for other options
hist age, normal

* 
*   - View bivariate distributions with scatterplots

/* scatterplots */
twoway (scatter educ age)
graph matrix educ age inc

* 
* 
* 3.2 The "by" command
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Sometimes, you'd like to generate output based on different
*     categories of a grouping variable
*   - The "by" command does just this
* 

/* By Processing */
// tabulate happy separately for men and women
bysort sex: tab happy
// summarize eudcation by marital status
bysort marital: sum educ

* 
* 
* 3.3 Exercise 2: Descriptive statistics
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   1. Use the dataset, gss.dta
*   2. Examine a few selected variables using the describe, sum and
*      codebook commands
*   3. Tabulate the variable, "marital" with and without labels
*   4. Summarize the variable, "income" separately for each level of
*      marital status
*   5. Cross-tabulate marital with region and show gender percent by
*      region
*   6. Summarize the variable, "happy" for married individuals only
*   7. Generate a histogram of income
*   8. Generate a second histogram of income, but this time, split income
*      based on participants sex and ask Stata to print the normal curve
*      on your histograms
* 
* 
* 4 Basic data management
* =======================
* 
* 4.1 Labels
* ~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - You never know why and when your data may be reviewed
*   - ALWAYS label every variable no matter how insignificant it may seem
*   - Stata uses two sets of labels: *variable labels* and *value labels*
*   - Variable labels are very easy to use -- value labels are a little
*     more complicated
* 
* 
* 4.2 Variable and value labels
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Variable labels

/* Labelling and renaming */
// Label variable inc "household income"
label var inc "household income"

// change the name 'educ' to 'education'
rename educ education

// you can search names and labels with 'lookfor' 
lookfor household

* 
*   - Value labels are a two step process: define a value label, then
*     assign defined label to variable(s)
* 

/*define a value label for sex */
label define mySexLabel 1 "Male" 2 "Female"
/* assign our label set to the sex variable*/
label val sex  mySexLabel

* 
* 
* 4.3 Exercise 3: Variable labels and value labels
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   1. Open the data set *gss.csv*
*   2. Familiarize yourself with the data using describe, sum, etc.
*   3. Rename and label variables using the following codebook:
*    *var*  *rename to*  *label with*        
*   -----------------------------------------
*    v1     marital      marital status      
*    v2     age          age of respondent   
*    v3     educ         education           
*    v4     sex          respondent's sex    
*    v5     inc          household income    
*    v6     happy        general happiness   
*    v7     region       region of interview 
*   -----------------------------------------
*   1. Add value labels to your "marital" variable using this codebook:
*    *value*  *label*         
*   --------------------------
*          1  "married"       
*          2  "widowed"       
*          3  "divorced"      
*          4  "separated"     
*          5  "never married" 
*   --------------------------
* 
* 
* 4.4 Working on subsets
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - It is often useful to select just those rows of your data where some
*     condition holds--for example select only rows where sex is 1 (male)
*   - The following operators allow you to do this:
*     ==: equal to
*     !=: not equal to
*     >: greater than
*     <: less than
*     >=: greater than or equal to
*     <=: less than or equal to
*     &: and
*     |: or
*   - Note the double equals signs for testing equality
* 
* 
* 4.5 Generating and replacing variables
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   - Create new variables using "gen"

// create a new variable named mc_inc
//   equal to inc minus the mean of inc
gen mc_inc = inc - 15.37

* 
*   - Sometimes useful to start with blank values and fill them in based
*     on values of existing variables
* 

/* the 'generate and replace' strategy */ 
// generate a column of missings
gen age_wealth = .
// Next, start adding your qualifications
replace age_wealth=1 if age<30 & inc < 10
replace age_wealth=2 if age<30 & inc > 10
replace age_wealth=3 if age>30 & inc < 10
replace age_wealth=4 if age>30 & inc > 10

// conditions can also be combined with "or"
gen young=0
replace young=1 if age_wealth==1 | age_wealth==2

* 
* 
* 4.6 Exercise 4: Manipulating variables
* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 
*   1. Use the dataset, gss.dta
*   2. Generate a new variable, age2 equal to age squared
*   3. Generate a new "high income" variable that will take on a value of
*      "1" if a person has an income value greater than "15" and "0"
*      otherwise
*   4. Generate a new divorced/separated dummy variable that will take on
*      a value of "1" if a person is either divorced or separated and "0"
*      otherwise
*
