    "## Cloud storage versus cloud computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Terms such as “cloud storage” and “cloud computing” are oftentimes used interchangeably. One may be tempted to believe they have the same meaning, but this is far from the truth. Indeed, they are actually different concepts eventhough they derived from the same source the cloud. The public cloud storage is a system that allows you to store data on the Internet, as you would save on your own computer. Some popular examples are Google Drive, DropBox, or iCloud,  for which the definition of cloud storage remains the same. Cloud computing, on the other hand, is used to work on and complete specified projects. Cloud computing is linked with cloud storage in that you have to move data to the cloud storage before you can make use of cloud computing systems. In the next part of the guide we are introducing Microsoft's object storage solution called Azure Blob storage and the one used for Machine Learning Studio (**to check:** they have different uses, not sure yet if it is just to different ways of accessing the same cloud storage)."

    "## Azure Storage Account\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's solution for the cloud and it stores massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data. Blob storage is ideal for serving images or documents directly to a browser, for storing files for distributed access and in our case for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service. Objects in Blob storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. We are going to access blobs storage via URLs using the Azure Storage REST API. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "As detailed in the Azure Blob Storage documentation, the service uses three resources [Blob service concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction#blob-service-concepts): your storage account, the containers in the account, and the blobs in a container. The following diagram shown in the  the relationship between these resources.\n",

    "![public_cloud_storage_concepts](img/public_cloud_storage_concepts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**to check:** image size change image to be similar to  (use CSS)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The **Storage Account** provides a unique namespace to store and access your Azure Storage data objects. All objects in a storage account are billed together as a group. By default, the data in your account is available only to you.\n",
    " - The **Container** provides a grouping of a set of blobs. All blobs must be in a container. It is similar to a folder in a file system.\n",
    " - The **Blob**, Binary Large OBject (BLOB), is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system [[wiki/Binary_large_object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object)]. Blobs are typically images, audio or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob. Azure Storage offers *three types of blobs*: block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs. Block blobs are ideal for storing text or binary files, such as documents and media files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upload file to Azure Blob Storage with Storage Explorer\n",
