You can use your documents but instead of querying them from folders saved in your hardware, they are secure in another place depending from the location you choose for your Azure Storage Account. The main reason for learning how to use storage are that a) it allows for an integrate use of the cloud computing softwares (SaaS) available from the provider and b) it allows to store up 195 GB in each container for an ideally ulimited number of containers (max size 4,7 Terabyte).\n",

Let say you have 1 terabyte large folder containing the your last survey, and you want to save it somewhere. With a remote storage you will spend x (todo estimate x) for the next three years compared to buy a new external drive (current price). You can move files from local to remote server inside your Microsoft Azure storage account simply by using applications designed with friendly user interface or using Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "Terms like “cloud storage” and “cloud computing” are sometimes used interchangeably. One might be tempted to think they have the same meaning, but this is not truth. They are different services eventhough they derived from the same source: the cloud. The public cloud storage is a system that allows you to store data on the Internet, as you would save on your own computer. Some popular examples are Google Drive, DropBox, or iCloud,  for which the definition of cloud storage remains the same. Cloud computing, on the other hand, is used to work on and complete specified projects. Cloud computing is linked with cloud storage in that you have to move data to the cloud storage before you can make use of cloud computing softwares. In the next part of the guide we are goind to show you how to use the Microsoft's object storage solution called Azure Storage Account using a \n",

    "## Azure Storage Account Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure storage account is Microsoft's solution for the cloud and it stores massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data. This storage is ideal for serving images or documents directly to a browser, for storing files for distributed access and in our case for analysis by an Azure-hosted service. Objects in the storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. We are going to access blobs storage both via Storage Explore application and URLs using the Azure Storage REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "As detailed in the Azure storage account documentation, the service uses three resources ([Intro Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction#blob-service-concepts)): your storage account, the containers in the account, and the blobs in a container. The following diagram shows the relationship between these three resources.\n",

    "![public_cloud_storage_concepts](img/public_cloud_storage_concepts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The **Storage Account** provides a unique namespace to store and access your Azure Storage data objects. All objects in a storage account are billed together as a group. By default, the data in your account is available only to you.\n",
    " - The **Container** provides a grouping of a set of blobs. All blobs must be in a container. It is similar to a folder in a file system.\n",
    " - The **Blob**, Binary Large OBject (BLOB), is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system [[wiki/Binary_large_object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object)]. Blobs are typically images, audio or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob. Azure Storage offers *three types of blobs*: block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs. Block blobs are ideal for storing text or binary files, such as documents and media files. We are going to use Block blobs.\n",
