    "Public Cloud services are useful tools to store and analyze documents' contents as well as to extract and process data. If you have never used a public cloud, you've probably already used: uploading documents to remote platform (some popular ones are DropBox, Google Drive, etc), transcribing an audio (after a set of interviews), copying and pasting data from webpage' images (who did not do that, right?) are some example of services that have been automated on public clouds to offer an on demand service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Azure is a platform that automates and enhances a lot of the tasks that arise when dealing with storing data, machine learning and cluster computing (check major platforms' websites for a more comprehensive overview, here is a link to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)). Azure is one of the top competitors for investments on public cloud services, (see [The Top 5 Cloud Computing Vendors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2017/11/07/the-top-5-cloud-computing-vendors-1-microsoft-2-amazon-3-ibm-4-salesforce-5-sap/#3f1473c56f2e)) being the one with greater investments as estimated recentely.\n",

While some cognitive services are accessible from the studio, some are not so we have to poke around to exploit the most interisting services available for social scientists. \n",

    "## Why should you use public cloud services?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ask different people, you'll get different answers, but one of the commonalities is that most people don't realize is that eventhough these services come with costs (i.e. both monetary and training), they provides great resources that social scientists should start exploring themself. Here are some highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ** You can use them “anytime, anywhere”: ** public cloud users can access, barely always, cloud services and keep their data stored safely in the infrastructure.\n",
    "- ** You won't *need* to plan far ahead for provisioning: ** public cloud users can use infinite computing computing and storaging resources available on demand. In this way, the user can offload some problems to the service provider such as mantaining the both hardware and software.\n",
    "- ** You can buy what you need, when you need it: ** public cloud allows you to use services eliminating any sort of up-front commitment by Cloud user.\n",
    "- ** Public cloud allows teams to collaborate: ** Public cloud allows you to share data and collaborate more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public cloud basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to understand about public cloud is that ... make analogy to introduce formal definition (are not any different from local software)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems\n",
    "software in the datacenters that provide those services. The datacenter hardware and software is what we will call a Cloud. When a Cloud is made available in a pay-as-you-go manner to the public, it is called a Public Cloud; the service being sold from the datacenter to the provider like Microsoft, Google or IBM (which might or not might be the same) called computing utility and the one service sold from provider to use that we will refer as a web application or more in general service (Armbust et al. call it Computing Utility)[1]. Current examples of public computing services include AmazonWeb Services, Google AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure. Private Cloud refers to internal datacenters of a business or other organization that are not made available to the public. The figure below shows the roles of the people as users or providers of these layers of Cloud Computing.\n",

    "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud as:\n",
    "\n",
    "_“a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud computing has 5 essential characteristics:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Measured Service\n",
    "2. Rapid Elasticity\n",
    "3. Broad Network Access\n",
    "4. Resource Pooling\n",

    "You can think about cloud computing as composition of three different areas/models:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Iass_Paas_SaaS_image](figs/name.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Infrastructure as a Service (**IaaS**) is a cloud of resources that provide resources to users produce better quality talents virtualization. Therefore, IaaS provides the basic functionality of storage and computing as service consisting in network servers, storage systems, network instrumentality, information headquarters, etc. are basic samples thereof.\n",
    " - The Platform as a Service (**PaaS**) is development environment provided as a service, and these advanced levels of alternative service can be designed by end-users. In alternative terminology, PaaS offers virtualized servers that multiple users work on applications or grow innovative applications, with no having to concern about keeping operating systems, server hardware, equalization or weight power calculation.\n",
    " - The Software as a Service (**SaaS**) is an application that is offered to consumers using the Internetwork. A single case of service works in the cloud and multiple end users services. An example of Cloud Computing is Software as a Service (SaaS), where you input data on software and the data is transformed remotely through a software interface without your computer being involved. Thus SaaS eliminates client fears on storage, server applications, application development, and related common concerns of IT. \n",
